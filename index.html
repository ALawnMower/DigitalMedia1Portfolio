  <div class="content">Welcome to my digital media one portfolio! (2020-2021)</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Here you will see all of my best digital media projects from this year!</p>
    <p>Digital Media is the process of analyzing, designing and developing interactive media. Digital Media I is the first-year digital media course where students will create and learn digital media applications while using elements of text, graphics, animation, sound, video, and digital imaging for various formats. These abilities will prepare students for entry-level multimedia positions and provide fundamental 21st Century Learning skills beneficial for other occupational/educational endeavors. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<strong>Goals of the Class:</strong> In this class, we are concerned about maintaining a blend of creativity and technicality. Some days exercising one more than another, but over time, we will grow in both. The artifacts that we create will be submitted in various file formats to Canvas and stored within individual portfolios that belong to you.</p>
