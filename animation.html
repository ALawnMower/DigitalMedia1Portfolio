    <p><strong>Animate Intro: Ball Bounce | January 21, 2021</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assignment Content Objectives</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Explore interface designs and file types
Tools: Drawing with Smooth Pencil, Shapes, Text etc...
Stage awareness
Symbols in your Flash library
Frames and Keyframes
Layers and Layer Types</strong></p>
    <p>Create 3 layers (background, floor, and ball)
	     Create a perfect circle and convert it to a symbol. Delete it from the stage.
	     Create a background, convert it to symbol and delete it from the stage.
	     Create a surface, convert it to symbol and delete it from the stage.
	     Drag symbols to their appropriate layers (lock layers that are motionless)
	     Animate the ball bouncing a minimum of 4 times adding 2 of the 12 principles of animation as it contacts the bottom, top or side surfaces
	     Apply onion skin aid to assist the path
	     Save your fla and "publish" as an mp4 </p>

    <p><strong>Ball Bounce II | January 27, 2021&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Introducing Tweening, Movie Symbols, and Instance Transforms</strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Animate can be used to create powerful frame based animations but its real power is in tweening. A tween is a co-property of a symbol as it resides on a layer. You can place a symbol in a position on or off the stage within a single keyframe, insert another keyframe on the same layer at a later point in time and change ANY property of the symbol over time and have Animate do the animation work for you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Content Objectives </strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;Recreate the ball bounce animation with tweening instead of frame by frame animation Transform the ball on each keyframe to change size or to squish the ball as it contacts the surface it bounces from Introduce another object to intercept the ball Have background tween</p>
    <p><strong>Ball Tween Animation Activity &nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;Create an Addobe Animate file with 3 layers (background, surface, and ball Create a symbol for each layer Apply motion tweens to the ball and even background layers Have the ball bounce off of a surface that appears to have depth on the stage Change the ball size on each of your keyframes to give the illusion of depth Create a new movie symbol and paste frames from each layer in the movie symbol</p>

    <p><strong>Walk Cycle |&nbsp; February 16, 2021</strong></p>
    <p>So far we have animated lifeless objects. Simulating organic objects (that are lifelike) can bring a fresh challenge. First we will revisit the idea of frame based animation and create a walk cycle of a human.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;Content Objectives: </strong>Students will trace a human figure in 8 blank keyframes creating each of the motions required to simulate a walk cycle. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Once you have your walk cycle complete (with 8 frames of walking animation) we will bring sound into the sequence in with the following goals: Foot step sounds to match the placement of each step Background ambient sounds or music (consider crowd, wind, storm, or other in/outdoor sounds)</p>

    <p><strong>&nbsp;Animate Your Favorite Phrase | February 24, 2021</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;We are going to incorporate audio into animation by animating the phonetics of a recording of your favorite phrase.&nbsp; To do this you will: Record and edit clear enunciation of your favorite phrase (must be at least five syllables). Import the wav version into Animate Choose a theme for the artwork (animation style or parody of pop culture like "Star Wars") Create layers for sound, base of a face/head, and mouth symbols. Create symbols for just the phonetic mouth sounds (all vowels and consonants) Mark with labels the transitions of each sound. Place the appropriate symbols (Links to an external site.) to time the animation sequence.</p>

    <p><strong>Animation with Sound | March 19, 2021&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>We previously created a 30 second audio  using Audacity. Now, armed with skills to animate, we will import that audio into a new Flash project that will contain the following: Title and Credits Sequence (this may extend the 30 seconds of audio) Layer titled "Actions" for scripting and text labels Layer for imported audio Layers for each symbol with tweening etc... New "Shape" tweening&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;30 seconds may seem like a daunting task in the world of animation (that is 720 frames using the default frame rate.) To break this down a bit, you will want to create a storyboard inside of your author file. After importing and placing your audio, you can create a layer called "Actions" and insert keyframes with text labels mapping out the events you need to animate. Next, it is a matter of creating all of the symbols needed in each sequence. Remember, you can create small sequences and save them as "Movie Symbols" to later introduce them when needed. </p>

    <p>Students will use their Project Proposal in an effort to complete their 10 hour project.</p>
